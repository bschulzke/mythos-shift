# Mythos Starter

Welcome to Mythos! If you haven't found it already, you'll want to check out the guide at
[mythos.dev](https://mythos.dev).

Mythos is a library for building text-based adventure games while learning computer programming.

## This project

This project is designed to get you up and running. You can
[download the ZIP file of the source from GitHub](https://github.com/mythos-dev/mythos-starter/archive/main.zip)
to get started.

## Project structure

The project, like many [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) projects, has a few main files and folders. If you just want to
get started, the code for the game is in the **src/** folder:
* **src/main/** has the code for your game.
* **src/test/** has the automated tests for your game.

These are the other files and folders you might see (some are hidden by default). They won't be needed right now, so
this is mostly for if you're curious:

* **gradle/** hosts the tool, [Gradle](https://gradle.org), which we use to build and run the project.
* **src/** is where your code goes.
* **.gitignore** tells [Git](https://git-scm.com/) which files to ignore when committing.
* **gradlew** and **gradlew.bat** can be used to run the game or the tests if you don't use IntelliJ.
* **build.gradle** tells Gradle how to run the game. You shouldn't need to change any settings in here just yet.
* **README.md** is this file you are reading!
